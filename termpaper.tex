\begin{sciabstract}
  This document presents a number of hints about how to set up your
  {\it Science\/} paper in \LaTeX\ .  We provide a template file,
  \texttt{scifile.tex}, that you can use to set up the \LaTeX\ source
  for your article.  An example of the style is the special
  \texttt{\{sciabstract\}} environment used to set up the abstract you
  see here.
\end{sciabstract}



% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.

\section*{Introduction}
As the user base of the internet is increasing, providing good quality of user experience is becoming a challenging task. To deal with this,various service providers are replicating their system states across various geographically diverse sites and when an user accesses the service, it is directed to the closest or the least loaded site. Such applications are now very common. Most of the leading companies like Google,Amazon and EBay - all claim that a slight increase in user-perceived latency translates into concrete revenue loss. So to provide better availability and disaster tolerance, applications replicated user data replicated across various sites. When an user accesses the service, it is forwarded to the closest or the least loades site.

This paper tries to solve the inherent tension between performance between performance and meaningful consistency. The first step towards this goal is to allow various levels of consistency to coexist. Some operations can be executed optimistically,without synchronizing with concurrent actions at other sites, while others require a stronger consistency level and thus require a cross-site synchronization. This paper proposes a novel consistency technique called RedBlue consistency is defined in which the blue operations are executed locally and lazily replicated in an eventual consistent manner. Red operations on the other hand are serialized with respect to each other and require cross site co-ordination. In such a unique consistency scheme, causality is maintained by ensuring that the dependencies established at the primary site when an operation is invoked is preserved when the operation is incorporated at some other site. As a developer, the first concern with this form of consistency is that one needs a clear cut strategy under which operations should be red or blue so that it is ensured that the application invariants are never violated and all replicas converge on the same final step. Since there are a few operations(Blue) which are lazily replicated, it might so happen that they are not always consistent. To address this, operations were basically divided into two components - a generator operation that identifies changes the original operation should make but has no side effects itself and the shadow operations that performs the identified changes and is replicated to all sites.


\subsection*{Properties of Geo-Replicated Systems}

Before we go into a broad description of how consistency is maintained in a geo-replicated system, one must understand the properties that a geo-replicated system should have. They are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Low Latency - A geo-replicated system should always provide low latency responses. Providing a good user experience by providing low latency access implies that the operation should proceed after contacting a small number of replicas. But this is at odds with the other requirements that a geo-replicated system should satisfy.
\item Causality - Causality is an important property that should be maintained both within a session and also across different replicas.
\item All replicas should execute the same set of operations and converge to the same final state.
\item All operations to all replicas should return the same value.
\item All replicas should have the same stable history. 
\item In maintaining the above the geo-replicated system should not restrict any operation.
\item All operations in any of the replicas should maintain the set of invariants. For e.g. No two users should accessing two different replicas should never have the same user id.
\item Eventual Propagation - All operations at a single replica should be propagated to other.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Levels of Consistency}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Strong Consistency - For strong consistency systems, replicated systems behaves like a single server that serializes all the operations. So the coordination among replicas lean to an overhead which is the delay in response.
\item Timeline/Snapshopt Consistency - Here there are two sites - a primary site that handles updates of all the replicas and a number of secondary states that acts as a read-only copy of the data. This kind of system although handles faster reads but writes always have an overhead.
\item Fork Consistency - This system relaxes the strong consistent system by allowing users to observe distinct causal histories. So the problem is once the replicas are forked, they cannot be reconciled.
\item Eventual Consistency - As the name suggests, all replicas diverge in short term as long as divergence is eventually repaired.
\item Multi Consistency - This kind of consistency eexposes multiple values exposed from divergent branches in operation.
\item RedBlue Consistency -  RedBlue consistency level is one where the above issues are somewhat taken care of. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Other Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consistency Rationing - Consistency rationing allows consistency guarantees to be associated with data instead of operations and in it consistency levels automatically swith at runtime between weak consistency and serializability based on specific policies
\item TACT - TACT bounds the amount of inconsistency of data items in an application specific manner based on numeric errors,order errors and staleness of data.
\end{enumerate}

RedBlue Consistency is better than these related work in the sense that it tries and handles consistency at the operation level and its main focus is not on adapting the consistency level of particular data items at runtime but on partitioning the operations according to their different actions.




\section*{RedBlue Consistency}
\subsection*{Assumptions}
Before defining what a RedBlue Consistent system is, it would be important to define a few assumptions that will in turn help us define the problem.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A distributed system with state fully replicated across $k$ sites denoted $site_0 \ldots site_{k-1}$
\item S $\in S$ denotes a system state and $u,v \in O$ a set of operations. 
\item Initial State - $S_0$. When operation $u$ is applied it goes to state $S'$. So $S' = S + u$
\item $ \forall$ S $\in S,$ S$+u+v = $ S $+v+u$
\item A state $S$ is valid if it satisfies all these invariants.
\item Each $u$ is submitted to one site which is called $u's$ primary site and denoted by $site(u)$.
\item The system later replicates $u$ to the other sites.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Defining RedBlue Consistency}
The definition of RedBlue consistency has two components -

\begin{defn}
 RedBlue order $\colon$ Given a set of operations $U = B \cup R$,where $B \cap R = \emptyset$, a RedBlue order is a partial order $O = ( U, \prec)$ with the restriction that $\forall u,v \in R$ such that $u \neq v, u \prec v $ or $v \prec u$ ($i.e.$ red operations are totally ordered).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
 Causal Serialization $\colon$ Given a site $i$, $O_i = (U, <)$ is an $i$-causal serialization(or short, a causal serialization) of RedBlue order $O = ( U, \prec)$ if 
 \begin{enumerate}
\item$O_i$ is a linear extension of O ($i.e$, < is a total order compatible with the partial order $\prec$ ) 
\item for any two operations $u,v \in U$, if $site(v) = i$ and $u < v$ in $O_i$ then $u \prec v$
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
RedBlue consistency $\colon$ A replicated sytem is O-RedBlue consistent(or short, RedBlue consistent) if each site i applies operations according to an i-causal serialization of RedBlue order $O$
\end{defn}
\subsection*{Formatting Citations}

Citations can be handled in one of three ways.  The most
straightforward (albeit labor-intensive) would be to hardwire your
citations into your \LaTeX\ source, as you would if you were using an
ordinary word processor.  Thus, your code might look something like
this:


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
However, this record of the solar nebula may have been
partly erased by the complex history of the meteorite
parent bodies, which includes collision-induced shock,
thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration
({\it 1, 2, 5--7\/}).
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


\noindent Compiled, the last two lines of the code above, of course, would give notecalls in {\it Science\/} style:

\begin{quote}
\ldots thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration ({\it 1, 2, 5--7\/}).
\end{quote}

Under the same logic, the author could set up his or her reference list as a simple enumeration,

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
{\bf References and Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item G. Gamow, {\it The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei
and Radioactivity\/} (Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1931).
\item W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, {\it Zeitschr.\ f.\ 
Physik\/} {\bf 56}, 1 (1929).
\end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent yielding

\begin{quote}
{\bf References and Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item G. Gamow, {\it The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei and
Radioactivity\/} (Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1931).
\item W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, {\it Zeitschr.\ f.\ Physik} {\bf 56},
1 (1929).
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

That's not a solution that's likely to appeal to everyone, however ---
especially not to users of B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ \cite{inclme}.  If you
are a B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ user, we suggest that you use the
\texttt{Science.bst} bibliography style file and the
\texttt{scicite.sty} package, both of which we are downloadable from our author help site
(http://www.sciencemag.org/about/authors/prep/TeX\_help/).  You can also
generate your reference lists by using the list environment
\texttt{\{thebibliography\}} at the end of your source document; here
again, you may find the \texttt{scicite.sty} file useful.

Whether you use B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ or \texttt{\{thebibliography\}}, be
very careful about how you set up your in-text reference calls and
notecalls.  In particular, observe the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please follow the style for references outlined at our author
  help site and embodied in recent issues of {\it Science}.  Each
  citation number should refer to a single reference; please do not
  concatenate several references under a single number.
\item Please cite your references and notes in text {\it only\/} using
  the standard \LaTeX\ \verb+\cite+ command, not another command
  driven by outside macros.
\item Please separate multiple citations within a single \verb+\cite+
  command using commas only; there should be {\it no space\/}
  between reference keynames.  That is, if you are citing two
  papers whose bibliography keys are \texttt{keyname1} and
  \texttt{keyname2}, the in-text cite should read
  \verb+\cite{keyname1,keyname2}+, {\it not\/}
  \verb+\cite{keyname1, keyname2}+.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Failure to follow these guidelines could lead
to the omission of the references in an accepted paper when the source
file is translated to Word via HTML.

\section*{Handling Math, Tables, and Figures}

Following are a few things to keep in mind in coding equations,
tables, and figures for submission to {\it Science}.

\paragraph*{In-line math.}  The utility that we use for converting
from \LaTeX\ to HTML handles in-line math relatively well.  It is best
to avoid using built-up fractions in in-line equations, and going for
the more boring ``slash'' presentation whenever possible --- that is,
for \verb+$a/b$+ (which comes out as $a/b$) rather than
\verb+$\frac{a}{b}$+ (which compiles as $\frac{a}{b}$).  Likewise,
HTML isn't tooled to handle certain overaccented special characters
in-line; for $\hat{\alpha}$ (coded \verb+$\hat{\alpha}$+), for
example, the HTML translation code will return [\^{}$(\alpha)$].
Don't drive yourself crazy --- but if it's possible to avoid such
constructs, please do so.  Please do not code arrays or matrices as
in-line math; display them instead.  And please keep your coding as
\TeX-y as possible --- avoid using specialized math macro packages
like \texttt{amstex.sty}.

\paragraph*{Displayed math.} Our HTML converter sets up \TeX\
displayed equations using nested HTML tables.  That works well for an
HTML presentation, but Word chokes when it comes across a nested
table in an HTML file.  We surmount that problem by simply cutting the
displayed equations out of the HTML before it's imported into Word,
and then replacing them in the Word document using either images or
equations generated by a Word equation editor.  Strictly speaking,
this procedure doesn't bear on how you should prepare your manuscript
--- although, for reasons best consigned to a note \cite{nattex}, we'd
prefer that you use native \TeX\ commands within displayed-math
environments, rather than \LaTeX\ sub-environments.

\paragraph*{Tables.}  The HTML converter that we use seems to handle
reasonably well simple tables generated using the \LaTeX\
\texttt{\{tabular\}} environment.  For very complicated tables, you
may want to consider generating them in a word processing program and
including them as a separate file.

\paragraph*{Figures.}  Figure callouts within the text should not be
in the form of \LaTeX\ references, but should simply be typed in ---
that is, \verb+(Fig. 1)+ rather than \verb+\ref{fig1}+.  For the
figures themselves, treatment can differ depending on whether the
manuscript is an initial submission or a final revision for acceptance
and publication.  For an initial submission and review copy, you can
use the \LaTeX\ \verb+{figure}+ environment and the
\verb+\includegraphics+ command to include your PostScript figures at
the end of the compiled PostScript file.  For the final revision,
however, the \verb+{figure}+ environment should {\it not\/} be used;
instead, the figure captions themselves should be typed in as regular
text at the end of the source file (an example is included here), and
the figures should be uploaded separately according to the Art
Department's instructions.


\section*{What to Send In}

What you should send to {\it Science\/} will depend on the stage your manuscript is in:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Important:} If you're sending in the initial submission of
  your manuscript (that is, the copy for evaluation and peer review),
  please send in {\it only\/} a PostScript or PDF version of the
  compiled file (including figures).  Please do not send in the \TeX\ 
  source, \texttt{.sty}, \texttt{.bbl}, or other associated files with
  your initial submission.  (For more information, please see the
  instructions at our Web submission site,
  http://www.submit2science.org/ .)
\item When the time comes for you to send in your revised final
  manuscript (i.e., after peer review), we require that you include
  all source files and generated files in your upload.  Thus, if the
  name of your main source document is \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, you
  need to include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ltxfile.tex}.
\item \texttt{ltxfile.aux}, the auxilliary file generated by the
  compilation.
\item A PostScript file (compiled using \texttt{dvips} or some other
  driver) of the \texttt{.dvi} file generated from
  \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, or a PDF file distilled from that
  PostScript.  You do not need to include the actual \texttt{.dvi}
  file in your upload.
\item From B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ users, your bibliography (\texttt{.bib})
  file, {\it and\/} the generated file \texttt{ltxfile.bbl} created
  when you run B{\small{IB}}\TeX.
\item Any additional \texttt{.sty} and \texttt{.bst} files called by
  the source code (though, for reasons noted earlier, we {\it
    strongly\/} discourage the use of such files beyond those
  mentioned in this document).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% Your references go at the end of the main text, and before the
% figures.  For this document we've used BibTeX, the .bib file
% scibib.bib, and the .bst file Science.bst.  The package scicite.sty
% was included to format the reference numbers according to *Science*
% style.


\bibliography{scibib}

\bibliographystyle{Science}



% Following is a new environment, {scilastnote}, that's defined in the
% preamble and that allows authors to add a reference at the end of the
% list that's not signaled in the text; such references are used in
% *Science* for acknowledgments of funding, help, etc.

\begin{scilastnote}
\item We've included in the template file \texttt{scifile.tex} a new
environment, \texttt{\{scilastnote\}}, that generates a numbered final
citation without a corresponding signal in the text.  This environment
can be used to generate a final numbered reference containing
acknowledgments, sources of funding, and the like, per {\it Science\/}
style.
\end{scilastnote}




% For your review copy (i.e., the file you initially send in for
% evaluation), you can use the {figure} environment and the
% \includegraphics command to stream your figures into the text, placing
% all figures at the end.  For the final, revised manuscript for
% acceptance and production, however, PostScript or other graphics
% should not be streamed into your compliled file.  Instead, set
% captions as simple paragraphs (with a \noindent tag), setting them
% off from the rest of the text with a \clearpage as shown  below, and
% submit figures as separate files according to the Art Department's
% instructions.


\clearpage

\noindent {\bf Fig. 1.} Please do not use figure environments to set
up your figures in the final (post-peer-review) draft, do not include graphics in your
source code, and do not cite figures in the text using \LaTeX\
\verb+\ref+ commands.  Instead, simply refer to the figure numbers in
the text per {\it Science\/} style, and include the list of captions at
the end of the document, coded as ordinary paragraphs as shown in the
\texttt{scifile.tex} template file.  Your actual figure files should
be submitted separately.
